### Hi, I'm Lars 👋

I’m passionate about signal processing, Linux, and enjoy contributing to free & open source software, especially Python’s scientific ecosystem. I'm an electrical engineer by education and currently work as a freelancer for the [🐍 scikit-image project](https://scikit-image.org) out of Dresden, Germany.

Feel free to message me if you want to get in touch or find me on [🌳 Scientific Python](https://discuss.scientific-python.org/u/lagru/), [🦊 GitLab](https://gitlab.com/lagru) or [🖇️ LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lars-grueter).
